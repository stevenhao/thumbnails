messing around with apple-touch-icon

Work in progress.

## Usage
1. Download graphics magick (https://github.com/aheckmann/gm)
2. Run the app locally
  
  i. Make sure the source image (path is hardcoded to a file in `/tmp/images` for now) exists and is the right dimensions

ii. Pages should be something like /b/2.png. If your iphone isn't the same dimensions as the default, you may need to mess with the constants in `graphics.js`.

3. Add each page to home screen (http://inspirelle.com/add-websites-home-screen-iphone-ipad/)
asically, open a tunnel (using something like https://ngrok.com/)
